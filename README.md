<p align="center"><strong>Server setup automation for the Ludice project</strong></p>

---

This repository contains two Ansible playbooks to automate the setup and configuration of the server environment for the Ludice project.

- One playbook configures the base server environment.
- The other deploys and manages the Ludice services.

These playbooks help streamline and simplify server provisioning and deployment processes.
